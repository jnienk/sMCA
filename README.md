To start:
Open Code > sMCAcalls.R

Users have the option of utilising an example data set, *comp.dat.txt*, which is a fully observed simulated data set (uniform distribution n=100, p=5). This is accompanied by *miss.dat.txt* which is the incomplete version of *comp.dat.txt* with 10% missing values inserted with a missing at random (MAR) mechanism.

Alternatively, incomplete categorical multivariate data sets may be inserted and used in the section for **sMCA and construction of biplot** in line 27-31.
